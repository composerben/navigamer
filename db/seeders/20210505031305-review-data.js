        { gameId: 6, userId: 2, rating: '9', review: `The ability to play as not one, not two... BUT THREE characters is fantastic.  The ability to switch characters at almost any moment in a mission is great!  The graphics, the gameplay, I can't recommend this game enough!`, createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() },
        { gameId: 7, userId: 3, rating: '10', review: `If you loved the first Red Dead, DO NOT MISS THIS!  The level of detail is incredible.  The game is so open that it feels never-ending.  It is easy to lose HOURS to this game without even realizing.`, createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() },
        { gameId: 8, userId: 4, rating: '10', review: 'Absolutely, undoubtedly, one of the best games released.  This will ALWAYS be a classic.', createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() },

        { gameId: 10, userId: 6, rating: '9', review: `This game was incredible from the release and only keeps getting better.  There are new states being released often and it makes the trucking experience that much more immersive!  If you're into simulations, give this game a chance!`, createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() },
        { gameId: 30, userId: 12, rating: '6', review: `Scarlet Nexus has some great fun to offer through its experimental and varied combat system, and there’s a deluge of skills, attacks, and counters to mish-mash against one another for increasingly satisfying results. What ultimately lets Bandai Namco’s action game down is outside of the action itself, where side characters never amount to memorable, enjoyable companions, and a side quest structure that feels more primed to provide the player with character-boosting XP than tales that capitalize on the intriguing glowing city surrounding them. Scarlet Nexus casts its eye over plenty of intriguing subjects in its plot, but it never lingers on one area long enough to properly analyze and break down the tough subject matter.`, createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() },
        { gameId: 15, userId: 11, rating: '7', review: `One thought that kept popping into my head while I was playing was just remembering how good Resident Evil 7 was. I recently completed another playthrough in preparation for this (along with some Revelations and Veronica, just because) and number 7's reverse home invasion slasher terror is still up there as one of the greatest horror games of all time. Resident Evil Village is an enjoyable, occasionally silly, monster hunt that's entertaining but almost completely resets all the incredible work Resident Evil 7 did to reinvent the series.`, createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() },
        { gameId: 12, userId: 10, rating: '6', review: `Overall it's been a weird one to review. I really enjoyed it, but the brevity feels like something to warn you about given that this is presented as a launch title. Even if you were expecting a small 'full' game, this is smaller. It plays like great DLC, because it is great and also clearly DLC, rather than a stand-alone expansion. Things like Left Behind and Lost Legacy worked because they were linear and gave the developer precise control over the pace and punch of a single story lasting a few hours. Here you've got a great story but one that takes place in a huge open world with little else overly meaningful to fill it. The story, characters, and action are all enjoyable, but if you unboxed your shiny new PS5 on Friday night and settled in to play this over the weekend, you'd likely reach the 'hoovering up collectibles because it's all that's left' stage before Monday came around.`, createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() },
        { gameId: 29, userId: 9, rating: '9', review: `It Takes Two is a unique experience that makes the most of what it means to offer truly co-operative gameplay. Your relationship with whoever you're playing with is just as important as that of May and Cody, as you'll get nowhere without robust communication and teamwork. But its blend of reality and fantasy is also refreshingly different, especially within a framework that offers the kind of unique gameplay that never stops surprising. `, createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() },
        { gameId: 11, userId: 8, rating: '8', review: `In spite of the serious concessions to depth made in the name of instant gratification, Call of Duty: Warzone remains thoroughly enjoyable. The battle royale formula is intact, albeit some of the aspects that usually make it so exciting and replayable are muted here. I’d love to see a reason to try something other than my Modern Warfare multiplayer loadout in the future given how easy it is to acquire, and think that the armor plate system and gulag are in need of revision. But my time spent in Verdask was still supremely fun even if the how and the why of it didn’t matter all that much.`, createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() },
        { gameId: 5, userId: 7, rating: '9', review: `Give it your patience and it’ll reward you with some of the best fights in any video game, poetic side stories and a world full of secrets. It’s the hardest game I’ve ever completed and yet, as soon as I beat the final boss, I booted up a new game. I’m determined to explore the side stories I missed - and stab that bloody ape in the neck just one more time.`, createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() },
        { gameId: 13, userId: 6, rating: '9', review: `For a game that can have such a high skill ceiling with crazy combos, it's excellent to see genuine care taken with welcoming newcomers. The story though is mostly going to be hot nonsense for those unfamiliar with the series, as it references and pays off on a surprising amount of lore - though enough is unique to this adventure and explained to the point where it makes a certain amount of thrilling sense. It's a wild, exhilarating ride from start to finish.`, createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() },
